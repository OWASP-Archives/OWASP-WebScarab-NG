/** We need to override the Default HTMLEditorKit to stop it from trying to follow
 * embedded links, such as framesets. This is because we don't know the
 * base URL of the HTML content we are rendering, and besides, we probably don't
 * want to go fetching embedded frames, which could possibly affect things on the
 * server. The ideal would probably be to get the most recent conversation for the
 * required URL from our local cache, but that becomes very intricate, and this is
 * probably good enough for now.
